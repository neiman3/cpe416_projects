Mac installation instructions 

1.  install Mac Crosspack:  http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html

  This will install gcc for the AVR microcontroller and other related tools.

2.  plug in the board and turn the board on

3.  edit the Makefile

  Find the 'program_mac' target in the Makefile in this directory and change the device to the usb device on your computer.  It should look something like this:  /dev/tty.usbserial-A602FK45.  Look for the device in the /dev directory and it should show up as something with tty.usbserial.

4.  type 'make' to compile the code in this directory

5.  type 'make program_mac' to flash the microcontroller.

  The board should start running your code once the flashing is complete.
