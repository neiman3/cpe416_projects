 * 
 * For part 1, write a program that gradually fades LED0 on and then off.  
 * Then, it should do the same with LED1 and then the program should repeat.  The fading effect should be smooth and without flicker.
 * 
 * You can make an LED appear partially on by turning the LED on and off in rapid succession.
